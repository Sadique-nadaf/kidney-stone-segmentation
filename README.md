# kidney-stone-segmentation
Simple kidney stone segmentation &amp; localization using OPENCV's basic operations.

This project focuses on detecting and segmenting kidney stones from medical images using computer vision techniques. The image processing workflow includes several steps: cropping the region of interest, converting the image to grayscale, applying a median filter for noise reduction, smoothing the image with a custom matrix, enhancing contrast using a top-hat filter, and binarizing the image. Morphological operations like erosion and dilation refine the image, followed by watershed segmentation to delineate the stones. K-means clustering is used to segment the image into distinct regions, which are then combined to create a binary mask applied to the original image. Technologies used in this project include OpenCV for image processing and visualization with Matplotlib.
